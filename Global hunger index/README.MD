The dataset provides valuable insights into the severity of hunger and malnutrition in various countries, highlighting the challenges faced by populations in accessing sufficient and nutritious food.

## About the Global Hunger Index

The Global Hunger Index is a widely recognized index that analyzes multiple factors such as undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality to present a holistic picture of the hunger situation globally. It takes into account both the prevalence and intensity of hunger, considering not only the lack of food but also the quality of nutrition and health outcomes.

The goals of the Global Hunger Index are:

- To draw attention to regions and countries where hunger is most prevalent and urgent.
- To serve as a crucial tool for policymakers, organizations, and governments to identify areas requiring immediate intervention and to formulate effective strategies for combating hunger and improving food security.
- To monitor progress and identify trends over time, enabling stakeholders to track improvements or setbacks in the fight against hunger.
- To provide an objective measure to evaluate the effectiveness of policies and interventions implemented to address hunger-related challenges.

## Dataset Details
